Nuxoll's notes (Fall 2019)

Upon reviewing Ed Epp's intro labs, I found them unsatisfying for these
major reasons (and some minor reasons I won't detail):
1.  The labs require a trememendous amount of reading and study from
    students.  Lab 1 has 75+ pages of content.
2.  The scope of the labs is too much too fast.  Students should not
    be doing event handling in lab 1, in my opinion.
3.  The code is fairly redundant with CS203's SnapShop assignment
4.  Too much of lab 2 and 3 content is about creating image filters.  It's
    not about learning the CS301 material.
5.  Much of the content is specific to the version of Android Studio
    that Ed developed the labs for.  This is now thoroughly
    out of date.  I removed many screenshots that are helpful but
    unnecessary as they would have be updated on an annual basis.  We
    don't have the bandwidth to do that an can't ask our adjunct
    instructors to do it either.
6.  The demo software (PhotoFun) runs very slowly on a tablet.

I've created a new revised lab that follows many of the same steps but
addresses all of the concerns above.

At present, I've created a shared GitHub account for starter code for
CS301 and CS371.  This is where I put the starter code for Lab 1.

The account is:
